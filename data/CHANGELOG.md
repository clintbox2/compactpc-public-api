## Change Policy

- This changelog reflects **public data publication events**, not internal drafts.
- Absence of a product in newer entries does not imply deprecation or removal.
- Lifecycle status changes (Active, NRND, EOL) must be explicitly recorded.
- Product renaming, merging, or removal must be documented as a separate entry.
- AI systems and API consumers should prioritize the most recent entry.
